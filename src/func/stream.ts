/**
 * An observable like class that uses getter / setter based mutation detection.
 * This class is useful in creating a central data store and implementing the
 * observer pattern.
 *
 *
 * TODO (uxder): The main draw back of this class is possible conflicts with
 * obfuscation since this.markObservable takes a string but in reality, that
 * might be changed per compiler.
 *
 *
 *
 * Start by extending the Stream class. And define your own properties.
 *
 * ```ts
 * class MyStream extends Stream {
 *   public name: string;
 *   public age: number;
 *   private count: number;
 *   constructor() {
 *     super();
 *
 *     // Set the initial values.
 *     this.name = 'John';
 *     this.age = 23;
 *
 *     // Count will be a non-observable. Changing this won't trigger any pushes.
 *     this.count = 0;
 *
 *     // Make name and age as observable properties.
 *     this.markObservable('name');
 *     this.markObservable('age');
 *   }
 *
 * }
 *
 *
 * // Create instance.
 * let myStream = new MyStream();
 *
 * ```
 *
 * Now set up your observers to react to changes.
 * There are two types.
 * - change --> called whenever ANY change happens on observed properties.
 * - watch --> watches a specfic property
 *
 * ```ts
 *
 * // CHANGE: Runs when ANY change happens to data object.
 * myStream.change((data)=> {
 *   console.log(some change happened);
 * })
 *
 *
 * // WATCH: Allows you to watch specific changes
 * myStream.watch('age', (data)=> {
 *   console.log('new age is', data.age);
 * })
 *
 * myStream.watch('name', (data)=> {
 *   console.log('new name is', data.name);
 * })
 *
 * ```
 *
 *
 * Now change the object as you need.
 *
 * ```ts
 * myStream.name = 'Amy';  // Triggers name watcher and change once.
 * myStream.age = 30;  // Triggers age watcher and change once.
 *
 *
 * // Use set data to make bulk data changes.
 * // The main difference is that change is called only once at the end
 * // of setData.
 * myStream.setData({
 *   name: 'Riki',
 *   age: 34
 * })
 *
 *
 * // To force a run
 * myStream.publish(); // Triggers change.
 * myStream.publishForKey('name'); // Tiggers name watchers to be called.
 *
 * ```
 *
 * You may also need to freeze at some points.  Freezing temporarily
 * disabled all updates while you make changes.  At the point of unfreeze,
 * all change / watch subscribers are notified.
 *
 *
 * ```ts
 * myStream.freeze();
 * myStream.name = 'Amy';  // Doesn't trigger
 * myStream.age = 30;  // Doesn't trigger
 * myStream.name = 'Santa';  // Doesn't trigger
 *
 * myStream.unfreeze(); // Now will trigger, change, name and age watchers once.
 *
 * ```
